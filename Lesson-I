| In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming
| language.

...

  |==                                                                            |   3%

| If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to R, you
| can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of resources (either
| within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively,
| a simple web search often yields the answer you're looking for.

...

  |====                                                                          |   5%

| In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and
| press Enter.

> 
> 5 + 7
[1] 12

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |======                                                                        |   8%

| R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and
| often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a calculator is to
| automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

...

  |========                                                                      |  11%

| In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation.
| Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just create a new variable
| that stores the result.

...

  |===========                                                                   |  14%

| The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator,
| which is just a 'less than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It looks like this: <-

...

  |=============                                                                 |  16%

| Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the
| right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the arrow.

...

  |===============                                                               |  19%

| To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This
| can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

> x <- 5 + 7

| You got it!

  |=================                                                             |  22%

| You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the
| assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result immediately, but
| rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.

...

  |===================                                                           |  24%

| To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

> x
[1] 12

| That's a job well done!

  |=====================                                                         |  27%

| Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

> y <- x - 3

| You are amazing!

  |=======================                                                       |  30%

| What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

> y
[1] 9

| You are amazing!

  |=========================                                                     |  32%

| Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that
| contains data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the simplest type of
| data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector of length
| one.

...

  |===========================                                                   |  35%

| The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for
| 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and
| 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called z.

> z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.4)

| That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more
| options.

| Inputting z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14) will assign the vector (1.1, 9, 3.14) to a new
| variable called z. Including single spaces after the commas in the vector is not
| required, but helps make your code less cluttered and more readable.

> z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)

| You are amazing!

  |==============================                                                |  38%

| Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in
| help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information on the c()
| function, type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a function name. Give
| it a try.

> ?c

| You are really on a roll!

  |================================                                              |  41%

| Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in
| the output.

> z
[1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

| That's a job well done!

  |==================================                                            |  43%

| You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z,
| 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so that
| we can just see the result immediately.

> z2 <- c(z, 555)

| Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Type c(z, 555, z). Don't create a new variable. We just want to view the result.

> c(z, 555, z)
[1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |====================================                                          |  46%

| Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what
| happens: z * 2 + 100.

> z * 2 + 100
[1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |======================================                                        |  49%

| First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each
| element to get the result you see above.

...

  |========================================                                      |  51%

| Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x
| squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take the absolute
| value, use the abs() function.

...

  |==========================================                                    |  54%

| Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)

| Excellent job!

  |============================================                                  |  57%

| Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?

1: a vector of length 3
2: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)

Selection: 1

| Great job!

  |==============================================                                |  59%

| Print the contents of my_sqrt.

> my_sqrt
[1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

| Excellent work!

  |================================================                              |  62%

| As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the
| square root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the same length as the
| original vector z.

...

  |===================================================                           |  65%

| Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.

> my_div <- z / my_sqrt

| You are doing so well!

  |=====================================================                         |  68%

| Which statement do you think is true?

1: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...
2: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
3: my_div is undefined

Selection: 1

| Excellent work!

  |=======================================================                       |  70%

| Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| That's a job well done!

  |=========================================================                     |  73%

| When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic
| operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors are of different
| lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the same length as the longer
| vector.

...

  |===========================================================                   |  76%

| When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but
| technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

...

  |=============================================================                 |  78%

| Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make
| a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it
| really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

...

  |===============================================================               |  81%

| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4)
| and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
[1]  1 12  3 14

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=================================================================             |  84%

| If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the
| longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw a warning to
| let you know something fishy might be going on.

...

  |===================================================================           |  86%

| Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

> c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
[1]   1  12 103   4
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |======================================================================        |  89%

| Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.

...

  |========================================================================      |  92%

| Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made a
| mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either re-type the
| expression, or...

...

  |==========================================================================    |  95%

| In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands.
| Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command (z * 2 +
| 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you,
| just type the corrected command.

> z * 2 + 1000
[1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

| Keep up the great work!

  |============================================================================  |  97%

| Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created
| earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv. You could
| try both and see what works, or...

...

  |==============================================================================| 100%

| You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key
| (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of
| variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion
| and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try.
| (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

> my_div
[1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

| You're the best!
